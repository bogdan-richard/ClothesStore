	API PACKAGE INFORMATION:
	- API is described in dd.casestudy.clothesstore.api.ClothesStoreApi
	- dd.casestudy.clothesstore.api.HttpCommands contains sample commands

MORE INFORMATION:
- used asynchrounus calls, to avoid blocking the UI, for example for HTTP communication
- tried to keep it simple, and at the time small enough to avoid redunancy
- product can be showed to clients at a review meeting
- to open the Cart Activity you must press the CART icon in the action bar

ABOUT TIME VS. QUALITY
I didn't know the exact amount of time, to spend on the project, so I will highlight out some possible improvements, if more time is avaible:
- plain custom UI, tested on Nexus 5 device, screen size independent UI needs further improvement
- improved UI
- no Android lifecycle events handled
- wishlist is not functioning
- more test elements, specially on network connection errors and etc...
- improved menu
- improved navigation
- more opportunity to do actions (remove from cart at CartActivity, etc...)
- etc...
